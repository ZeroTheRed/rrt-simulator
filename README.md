# rrt-simulator
A basic Python program that simulates the RRT path-finding algorithm

## Screenshots:
* **Red** - Starting Point
* **Blue** - Goal region
* **Black** - Obstacles
* **Green** - The points generated to help construct the tree (they are not the actual nodes added. They exist to assist in the creation of the node to be added)

## Dependencies (Libraries)
pygame, numpy

## To-do list (which will be updated on the go):
1. The code requires some polishing to improve readability
2. Highlight the (not necessarily optimal) path from the start to the goal point
