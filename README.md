# rrt-simulator
A basic Python program that simulates the RRT path-finding algorithm

Dependencies (libraries) required to run the simulator: pygame, numpy

To-do list (which will be updated on the go):
1.) The code requires some polishing to improve readability
2.) Highlight the (not necessarily optimal) path from the start to the goal point
